# Tscript
A sophisticated automation script for the strategy game "Travian"

the "Tscript-008-with-empty-oasis" version is used to raid empty oases, the logic behind it - is that by doing so you could collect loot from empty oases.
most players will not do it because it is so time consuming to raid empty oasis just for a small amount of loot, but by doing it with our automated script we lose no time from our lives and gain those small loot amounts.
